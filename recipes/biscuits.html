    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is my <em>favorite</em> biscuit recipe. My grandma always used to serve 
        them up frozen for us kids to enjoy. I remember the smell like it 
        was just 25 years ago. My sister never liked them as much as I did 
        which is why I was always grandmas favorite. </p>
    <p>You can serve these biscuits <strong>frozen</strong> or <strong>room temperature</strong>. Any toppings 
        will do. Just throw in whatever's left over in the fridge. You'll love 
        it and hubby who is a picky eater will too. </p>
